# hamming_code_using_behavioural_Style_with_topmodule

so this program consists topmodule also and it works on nexas4 board

and i have selected while performing this experiment as follows
family:artix-7
board:xca100tg324-1

i have dumped the program into the board through vivado
so in vivado you have to create constraint file(.XDC) for performing on fpga board

here i am providing xdc file ,so you have to just paste it

output:it will work on seven segment displays,so each seven segment led will be turned on accoring to the on board leds value(leds value from 0-6(in binary) ,these values will show on those leds)

first two switches are for eanbling the data-->hammingcode and hammingcode->op_corrected_code(0,1)
next 4 switches for data(2,3,4,5)
next 7 switches for input hammingcode(6,7,8,9,10,11,12)
next switch is for enabling the hammingcode and op_correctedcode(13)
